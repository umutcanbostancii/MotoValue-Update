   - Status: ✅ COMPLETED

3. Security Implementation

## Current State
- Authentication: Supabase
- Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- Security: RLS + Role-based access
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
- Tables:
  - dealer_users
  - dealers
  - motorcycles
  - price_algorithms
  - price_calculations

## Next Steps
1. Price Calculation Algorithm Implementation
2. User Interface Development
3. Performance Optimization

## Project Rules
1. All tables must have updated_at and created_at
2. All updates must use triggers for timestamp management
3. All tables must have RLS policies
4. All user access must be role-based
5. All code changes must be documented here

## Notes for AI
- Previous authentication was Firebase
- Current authentication is Supabase
- Role types: 'user', 'admin', 'dealer'
- Main tables and their relationships are documented
- Security policies are in place and tested
